# ESM-Inpainting

 Using ESMFold to generate scaffold proteins for the functional sites (which is also called inpainting). The basic formuler is $s,t \sim f_{\theta}(\hat{s},\hat{t})$ , $s,\hat{s},t,\hat{t}$ is the whole sequene, whole structures, motif seqs and motif structures. $f_{\theta}$ is the ESM-Inpainting network and its parameters.
